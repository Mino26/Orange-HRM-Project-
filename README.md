1.1  <h4>Test planning</h4>

<p>The Test Plan is designed to describe all details of testing for the Admin module from the OrangeHRM application.
The plan identifies the items to be tested, the features to be tested, the types of testing to be performed, the personnel responsible for testing, the resources and schedule required to complete testing, and the risks associated with the plan.</p>

 1.1.1<h4>Roles assigned to the project and persons allocated</h4> 
| Admin module  | Job |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Minodora Bianca| Minodora Bianca |

1.1.2 <h4>Entry criteria</h4> 

Entry criteria for software testing must be clearly defined to ensure a smooth and effective testing process. Before testing can begin, the following conditions must be met:
<ol>
  <li>Availability of the required software builds and versions.</li>
  <li>Completion of test enviorment setup and configuration</li>
<li>Preparation and documentation of test cases, ensuring coverage of all relevant scenarios</li>
<li>Confirmation of readliness from stakeholders or project management</li>
	
</ol>

***

1.1.3 <h4>Exit criteria </h4>

<ol>
  <li>Test coverage goals have been achieved, ensuring that all critical functionalities and use cases have been tested</li>
  <li>All acceptance criteria outlined in the project requirements or user stories have been satisfied</li>
<li>All high-priority defects have been resolved</li>
	
</ol>

***


1.1.4 <h4>Test scope</h4>

Tests in scope:
<ol>
  <li>Admin Module and Job to function at its max capacity without any error ocurred</li> 
	<li>Regression testing</li>
	<li>Early testing</li>
	<li>Positive and Negative testing</li>
</ol>

Tests not in scope:  
<ol>

1.1.5 <h4>Risks detected</h4>
| Risks         | 
| ------------- | 
| user data    ( permissions, user roles, sensitive data)
| compatibility issues |


<p>Risks: user data (permissions, user roles, sensitive data etc) might be impacted with update tests,
Safari browser might have performance issues or compatibility issues
website doesnâ€™t support 100 users.</p>

***

1.1.6 <h4>Evaluating entry criteria</h4>

| Evaluating Entry Criteria        | 
| ------------- | 
| smoke test passed
| the test planning have been achieved test process can continue |

<p>Entry criterias:
smoke test passed (being the most basic type of test, this is a very important entry criteria in the process of testing)
testing environment is up and running.</p>

<h5>The entry criterias defined in the Test Planning phase have been achieved and the test process can continue.</h5>

Testing the log in functionality,

Verification log in,

<p>Test Case 1:</p>	
    Description: Test login successfully
		
  Preliminary conditions: The user must be on the log in page
		
  <p>Execution steps:</p>
    
  1. Enter valid user
  2. Enter valid password 
  3. Press the log in button 
     
   Test data: 
	   <ol>
    <li>user valid / password valid</li>
		<li>Current results: log in succsefully</li>
		<li>Expected results: The user must be redirected to the home page</li> 
  </ol>

<p>Exit criterias:
92% of tests are passed
no Critical issues have Open status
update tests are 100% passed (update tests will not generate other new issues that impact the application)</p>



 1.2 Test Monitoring and Control

  
  
 1.3 Test Analysis
 
The testing process will be executed based on the above requirements for the Dependents module. The following test conditions were found:

1.4 Test Design

Functional test cases were created in Zephyr Squad. Based on the analysis of the specifications, the test design techniques used for generating test cases are:

Test cases: -> Job, Job Title, Job add Button, Pay Grades, Employment status, Job Categories, Organization , Work shifts

The test cases with steps can be viewed here: [test_cases.pdf](https://github.com/Mino26/Orange-HRM-Project-/files/14165184/test_cases.pdf)

1.5 Test Implementation

The following elements are needed to be ready before the test execution phase begins.

here what needs to be ready for the test execution to begin:

Ensure that the test enviorment is set up, test data is prepared and all necessary test resources, including test script and tools are in place.

Verify that the system under test is stable and ready for testing.


1.6 Test Execution

Test cases are executed on the created test Cycle summary: [cycle_summary.pdf](https://github.com/Mino26/Orange-HRM-Project-/files/14165225/cycle_summary.pdf)

The complete bug reports can be found here: 
Work shifts ->[BUG.pdf](https://github.com/Mino26/Orange-HRM-Project-/files/14524971/MIN-24.3.pdf)



1.7 Test Completion
Exit criteria was evaluated and passed
